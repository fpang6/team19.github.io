	<p class="bios">Hi, my name is Mark and I study Bioinformatics at UWO. Over the years Ive become experienced in python and java through courses in high school/university and through side projects that I work on to keep myself busy. Im currently interested in IOS development and the swift programming language. I have chosen to do front-end for this project to expand my skill set and to try something new, I'm looking forward to diving deep into HTML,CSS and javascript. In my spare time I like to keep up with shows such as Silicon Valley, MCM and Roadkill.

  <h3 class="names">FINA PANG</h3>
  <p class="bios">Hi, my name is Fina and I am currently enrolled in the computer science program at Western University. I first gained exposure to programming through two online courses that I took during the summer of Grade 12 in high school. Since then, I have been able to further develop my skills in Python, Java, C, and VBA. I think that each programming language is fascinating in its own way, and object-oriented design in general is something that entices me. For this project, I will be focused on the front-end development, because it is something that I have had little exposure to, and would love to use this opportunity to further develop my skills in this area. In my spare time, I enjoy playing team sports and relaxing to a movie or two.

Over two years’ study, I become experienced in python, java, C/C++ and SQL through courses in university and through side projects that I work on to keep myself busy. I am currently learning in IOS development and the swift programming language. I have chosen to do back-end and build database for this project to expand my skill set and to try something new, I'm more interested in learning more experienced into HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

  <h3 class="names">SAMIR KAZI</h3>
  <p class="bios">Hi my name is Samir and I'm currently persuing my bachelors in Computer Scienece at the University of Western Ontario. My Career at University started with me in premed, then I discovered my passion for Computational Science. I have experience with Python, Java, C, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. Currently I'm expanding my skillset by learning Swift and iOS development. I have taken the role of being partaking in both front-end and back-end development for the project. I'll be responible for bridging the two aspects of our project together. When I'm not accelerating my inevitable carpal tunnel, I like to relax by working out, hanging out with friends, or avoid human interaction with infinite netflix hours.

  <h3 class="names">ZENEN TREADWELL</h3>
  <p class="bios">Hey! My name's Zenen Treadwell, I'm currently studying Computer Science at Western University. Despite a life-long history of using computers to play video games and occasionally learn about things, I only got involved with the more technical side in high school. So far I have experience in Java, Python, and C; for this project I am working on learning to use Groovy and the Grails framework. My passion for software development comes from me thinking of it as a sort of "math art", a place where science and logic can be expressed with a personal style. My other hobbies include: being outside, cooking, contemplating the human condition, and music.

  <p class="bios">Hi, my name is Brandon and I am currently enrolled at the University of Western Ontario, studying computer science. Throughout my educational career, I’ve become experienced in Python, Java, and C, through courses in high school, university and through small personal projects that I work on to keep myself busy. I’m currently interested in software development and software production. I have chosen to do back-end for this project to expand my skill set and to try to hone my skills with Java high-level programming. When not coding, I enjoy spending time with friends, playing video games, camping, and playing the guitar.

  <p class="bios">Hey, I’m Jason Chung and I’m doing an Honours Spec. in Computer Science at Western University. I started programming in high school until now and along the way, I picked up on how to program in Java, Python, C, and Visual Basic. On my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, doing sports, and hanging out with friends and family. For this project, I will be doing both front and backend stuff, focusing on merging the two ends together. After this project, I hope to learn a lot more about JavaScript and backend material in general!

  <h3 class="names">SEAN HUGGINS</h3>
  <p class="bios">Hi there! I'm Sean Huggins, a second year Computer Science and Astrophysics major at Western University. I came into Western lacking even the slightest interest in studying computer science, but after taking a first year elective I fell in love with the profession's endless creative potential. So far I've gained a proficiency in Java, with novice experience in Python, C, HTML, CSS and Matlab. In my spare time, I enjoy making games in raw Java, playing the drums, skiing, cooking a mean szechuan stir fry, and watching TV shows such as Black Mirror, Rick and Morty, and Mr. Robot. For our project, I'll be helping develop the back-end, and I'm most looking to forward to learning how to utilize particular API's so that we can scrape and sort data into a usable format.
