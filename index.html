  <p>Throughout this project and course, the eight of us will work together to experience building a software project in a group environment. Through this project, we will gain better team management skills, collaborative skills, as well as more insight into programming.</p>
</div>
<div class="homeBox col-md-6 homeDesc">
  <p> Our software is a web-based application that enables users to find nearby events. This will be a social networking platform where users may click “attending” to an event, see which of their friends are also planning on attending, and invite their friends to events as well. A user may choose to use the application as a guest, to just browse through events, but certain other features will be disabled (such as connecting with friends through the app). If the user chooses to login through their Facebook account, then they will have access to a profile as well as a list of friends who have also signed up for the app. Users may search events by category or by geographic area. </p>
  
</div>
<div class="homeBox col-md-6 homeDesc">
  <p> We plan on using a combination of flat design and responsive design for our application. We will be aiming for a design that is clean, has open space, crisp edges, bright colours and two-dimensional/flat illustrations. Our web page will be responsive in the sense that if the user minimizes the screen, the amount of content will minimize accordingly. Our webpage will also be inspired by Tumblr’s simple interface as well as Netflix’s layout. </p>
